The two-semester sequence of Studio courses, which fulfills the College’s first-year writing requirement, is taught as a seminar of 10 students per section that meets twice per week. It is designed to give students the opportunity to learn and practice essential steps in writing the kinds of academic essays assigned in their Harvard courses, not personal essays but rather analytical arguments that engage sources. The curriculum is structured so that students begin each course with shorter assignments, giving students multiple rounds of practice with the core elements of academic argument; each course then builds up to more complex essay assignments later in the semester. Each of the writing assignments in the fall semester course focuses on a compelling social or ethical question; the writing assignments in the spring semester course introduce students to a wider repertoire of the kind of analytical operations undergraduates will be expected to deploy when writing at Harvard, from closely reading evidence to comparing sources’ ideas, to placing primary and secondary sources into conversation in a research paper.Because sections of Studio courses are smaller and the assignments are shorter, students can work on their writing in a more hands-on way, with frequent feedback from their preceptor and their peers. During each semester, students work on a variety of skills: they participate in workshops on sentences, paragraphs, and whole arguments; they go beyond the classroom to gather observations and evidence for their analytical essays. In both the shorter assignments and the major analytical essays, students write an initial draft, receive feedback, and revise their work, learning how to develop, organize, and clarify their ideas. All of the assignments invite students to think critically about sources: asking questions, analyzing, and building arguments about the sources they work with.Students choose to take the Program’s sequence of introductory courses for a variety of reasons: some know that they haven’t written extensively in their previous courses and want more experience, while others feel unfamiliar with the conventions of the American academic essay; some have strengths at other kinds of writing but have less experience in the kind of analytical writing that Harvard courses will require; and some want to gain more confidence as they approach the expectations of college writing.The Program’s introductory writing courses have a planned curriculum administered across all sections, with common assignments, readings, and exercises designed through regular collaborations among the Expos Studio 10 and Studio 20 teaching staff.Expository Writing 20Expository Writing 20, or “Expos 20,” as it is called in the College, is the one-term course that fulfills the undergraduate writing requirement. A full-time teaching load for preceptors teaching Expos 20 is two sections of the course per term. The course, taught as a seminar of 15 students per section that meets twice per week, is an introduction to the academic essay and is focused on argumentation: thesis, evidence, analysis, structure, and use of sources. Most Harvard first-years have heard those terms before, and most have written fairly fluent short essays of the five-paragraph type. In Expos 20, students develop a new understanding of those terms and learn to write papers that dig into their texts and topics in order to discover worthwhile, nuanced arguments about them—arguments that use sources in different ways and that deepen and develop as they go.The Program collaborates with preceptors to develop course topics and readings that appeal to a general first-year audience: e.g., Free Speech in a Digital World; Rationality and the Supernatural; Dark Matter, Grey Matter, and Scientific Complexity; “Noncombatants”: The Home Front in Total War; Personhood in U.S. Constitutional Law; Do No Harm? Healthcare’s Limits; The Art and Science of Learning. The topics and readings are carefully selected with academic writing in mind; each course is arranged in three units that focus students on, and prepare them to write, three essays of different kinds. Each unit involves several writing exercises, a pre-draft assignment, a draft, an individual conference, a class workshop, and a graded revision. Especially during conference weeks, the work is intensive, the students eager and demanding. But the work pays off, and the writing of most students improves markedly over the term.The Program incorporates innovative approaches into its curricula. Our Engaged Scholarship Expos courses invite students to connect the theory and practice of academic research and writing as students go outside the classroom into neighborhoods and organizations to see real-world issues up close. Various courses in the Program also benefit from partnerships with Harvard’s Bok Center for Teaching and Learning, the Harvard College Library, the Harvard University Art Museums, and other Harvard offices and programs that put students and instructors alike in contact with experts in numerous fields, diverse readers, and multimedia tools with which to research and communicate ideas. In the past few years, an increasing number of faculty members are also asking students to work on capstone projects, which give students the opportunity to translate their writing and ideas into other formats for audiences outside of their class.Faculty Development for Expos 20 and Studio Preceptors in the Writing ProgramSince the Program is thoroughly focused on teaching, new as well as veteran preceptors spend considerable time planning their classes and contributing teaching materials in what is an open-source community. New preceptors also receive plenty of mentoring. They attend orientation sessions in the summer before teaching starts; they are provided with many pedagogical materials, and a good deal of help developing their courses—by the Program’s Director, Senior Preceptors, and a Head Preceptor who is assigned to mentor and supervise them during their first year. There are also regular faculty meetings on topics of common pedagogical interest—in addition to the lively collegial exchanges that occur routinely in informal settings. Preceptors are strongly encouraged to contribute in a highly collaborative environment to the Program’s development of pedagogical materials and teaching strategies as well as to its development of new projects aimed at enhancing the culture of writing instruction in the College.Basic QualificationsDoctorate (or Doctorate nearly completed) in traditional liberal arts and sciences discipline taught in Harvard College, including fields in the sciences and social sciences, or MFA or terminal degree with relevant experience teaching writing in a field taught in Harvard College.Additional QualificationsWe welcome applications from candidates with experience and expertise in the teaching of writing in STEM fields, the social sciences, or public policy; with experience and/or strong interest in integrating multimedia and digital learning into course design and class activities, or designing innovative capstone projects.Special InstructionsAll applicants will be asked to upload the following materials using the document fields indicated in parentheses:A CV (CV)A cover letter explaining their philosophy of teaching writing and relevant undergraduate teaching experience (Cover Letter)A sample of expository writing of no more than 10 pages, which may be a 10-page excerpt of a longer piece of writing (Writing Sample 1)Teaching materials from past or current courses, including past syllabi, writing assignments, and the like (Sample Syllabus)Proposed course materials outlined below (Proposed Course Descriptions)Candidates are welcome, but not required, to submit a separate Statement of Teaching Philosophy to complement what they discuss in their cover letter (Statement of Teaching Philosophy)Note: Applicants should upload the requested course materials for the course(s) they are applying to teach.

Tenure-track faculty at SCU are teaching scholars who are expected to balance teaching, research/creative work, and service. This is an in-person position. Faculty duties are governed by departmental policy and SCU’s Faculty Handbook. More specifically, duties include but are not limited to the following:

TEACHING:

1. Teach lower- and upper-division courses in the major and university core curriculum, as assigned by the chair, including courses such as foundation courses for the major, courses in the candidate’s areas of specialization, core writing courses (first-year and advanced writing), and new courses.

Teaching will be evaluated according to the Teaching Effectiveness Standards and Evaluation (TESE) document developed by each department. Ignatian pedagogy, a hallmark of Jesuit, Catholic universities, is based on the principle of cura personalis, that is, teaching the whole person. At Santa Clara University we define effectiveness in teaching as respectful, challenging, inclusive, engaging, and evidence based. Teaching Expectations and Academic Policies at SCU can be found here.


RESEARCH/CREATIVE WORK:

1. Develop a program of research or creative work at SCU that will result in meeting the English Department’s established scholarship/creative standards.

2. The Department of English encourages faculty to involve undergraduate students in faculty research and creative work.

SCU offers significant support to early career faculty in the development of their program of research or creative work.
